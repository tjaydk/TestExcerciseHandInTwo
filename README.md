The applications are written in C#
Test cases are created in the MS Unit Framework

For the Code Coverage excercise i've used this [Triangle application](https://github.com/tjaydk/TriangleTest) for coverage analysis.
Here is a screenshot of the coverage analysis.

I've used JetBrains ReSharper for code analysis.

As none of the applications main features are tested, this could be up for future unit tests as these are also important
in order to determine that the input functionality actually works.
